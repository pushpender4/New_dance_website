//- this file is just for navbar and footer \
//- reason behind to keep the seperate file is that we can extend this navbar and footer in many subpages like contact services aboutus etc 
//- so we don't need to write extra html for subpages all we need to do is to extend base.pug which includes all the 
//- navbar structure which will remain same on all pages

//- example how to include this file into other subpages

//- [extends base.pug]
